Introduction
Image classification is a critical task in computer vision where the goal is to classify images into predefined categories. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to process image data and build an accurate classification model.

The project was developed as part of the AICTE Internship Program to enhance practical knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Features
Preprocessing of image data.
Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification.
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy.
Easy-to-follow code and comments for understanding.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The project uses a dataset consisting of labeled images from a specific domain. You can either:

Use your own dataset.
Download publicly available datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST.
Note: Ensure that the dataset is structured into separate folders for each category, as required by the script.

Installation
bash
cd P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship
Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: A requirements.txt file should list the necessary Python libraries.

Usage
Place the dataset in the project directory.
Run the Python script to preprocess data and train the model:
bash
Copy code
python image_classification.py
View the results, including accuracy metrics and visualizations.
Results
The model achieves satisfactory accuracy in classifying images into categories. The results can be improved with advanced techniques like:

Data augmentation
Hyperparameter tuning
Using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
